# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection using BERT & XLNet

This project applies cutting-edge transformer-based models (BERT and XLNet) to the task of **fake news detection** in English-language news articles. It demonstrates how powerful pretrained language models can be fine-tuned for binary classification tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP).

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- **Goal**: Classify news articles as **FAKE** or **REAL**
- **Models used**:
  - BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
  - XLNet (Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding)
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Tokenization using HuggingFace Transformers
- Fine-tuning BERT and XLNet on fake news classification
- Binary classification: FAKE vs. REAL
- Evaluation with multiple metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
- Confusion matrix visualization
- Performance comparison between BERT and XLNet

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Results

| Model  | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|--------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| BERT   | 95.2%    | 95.4%     | 94.9%  | 95.1%    |
| XLNet  | 96.1%    | 96.0%     | 96.2%  | 96.0%    |

ðŸ“Œ *Note: Results may vary depending on random seed, dataset split, and training configuration.*

## ðŸ¤” Key Challenges

- Preprocessing long text sequences and truncation
- Handling class imbalance in fake/real distribution
- Managing GPU memory with large transformer models

## ðŸ’¡ Insights

- XLNet slightly outperformed BERT, possibly due to its permutation-based training.
- Fine-tuning only the last few layers of BERT gave almost similar results while saving training time.

## ðŸ”® Future Work

- Apply RoBERTa and DeBERTa for performance comparison
- Integrate attention visualization for explainability
- Deploy model as a web API using FastAPI or Flask
